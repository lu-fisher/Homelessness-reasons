# Homelessness-reasons

Analysis of local authority homelessness statistics, reasons for prevention duties being owed and reasons for successful preventions. Including area statistics from census data (unemployment, population density and deprivation), Homelessness Prevention Grant allocations and housing affordability ratios for each local authority area.

Notebook 1 (Data preparation)
Importing the data from various spreadsheets available on the government statistics site.
Cleaning the data and joining it into a master dataframe for analysis. Saving csv files.

Notebook 2 (Data analysis)
Analysed the reasons for homelessness and how these changed over time, then the reasons for successful preventions and how these changed. 
Looked at which local authorities have the highest proportion of homelessness from the private sector.
Used South Gloucestershire as an example comparator to the mean values.
Looked for correlation between the census area statistics and homelessness.

Notebook 3 (Machine learning)
Created model to predict the number of successful preventions achieved by a local authority.
Created various models to predict the number of households threatened with homelessness in an area.
Tested a hypothesis that successful preventions would increase if grant funding increased.
